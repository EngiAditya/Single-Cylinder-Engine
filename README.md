# üöó Single-Cylinder Engine ‚Äì CAD & FEA Analysis

This repository contains the design and **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)** files for a **Single-Cylinder Engine**. The project includes the **CAD model**, and several types of **structural**, **thermal**, and **vibration analyses** performed using **ANSYS Workbench** to evaluate the engine's performance and durability under various operating conditions.
## üß© Components in the Model

The single-cylinder engine design consists of the following main components:
- **Upper Case**
- **Piston**
- **Crankshaft**
- **Cylinder Head**
- **Connecting Rod**
- **Lower Case**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies

- **CAD Software**: SolidWorks
- **Simulation Platform**: ANSYS Workbench
- **Analysis Types**:
  - Static Structural Analysis
  - Transient Structural Analysis
  - Modal Analysis
  - Random Vibration Analysis
  - Steady-State Thermal Analysis

## üîç Analysis Summary

### 1. **Static Structural Analysis**
- Purpose: To evaluate the stress distribution, deformation, and potential failure points under static loads.
- Observations: The engine block and crankshaft are subject to significant stresses at certain contact points.
- Output: Von Mises stress, displacement, and strain distribution.

### 2. **Transient Structural Analysis**
- Purpose: To study the time-varying loads and dynamic behavior of the engine components under operational conditions.
- Observations: Investigated how the engine parts respond to dynamic loads during operation, focusing on displacement and stress over time.
- Output: Time-based stress and displacement response plots.

### 3. **Modal Analysis**
- Purpose: To identify the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the engine components.
- Observations: First few modes identified, important for avoiding resonance during operation.
- Output: Frequency response plots and mode shapes.

### 4. **Random Vibration Analysis**
- Purpose: To simulate the engine's response to random dynamic loads, such as road irregularities or vibrations during operation.
- Observations: Peak acceleration and displacement response of key components.
- Output: Power spectral density and vibration response plots.

### 5. **Steady-State Thermal Analysis**
- Purpose: To evaluate the temperature distribution and thermal stresses within the engine during normal operation.
- Observations: Engine components show significant thermal gradients, especially near the cylinder head and piston.
- Output: Temperature contours and thermal stress distribution.
